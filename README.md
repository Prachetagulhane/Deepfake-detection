# Deepfake-detection
Machine learning approaches for detecting duplicate deepfake videos using CNN
Deepfake images are computer-generated pictures that look very real but are actually fake. People use deepfakes for fun, but sometimes they can be misused for fraud, fake news, or identity theft. Many times, the same deepfake image is copied and used in different places, making it hard to track them.

This project focuses on using Machine Learning (ML) to find and detect duplicate deepfake images. We will use a special type of ML model called a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is great at recognizing patterns in images.

Why Is This Important?
If we can detect duplicate deepfake images, we can stop their spread and misuse. Traditional methods, like checking file names or metadata, donâ€™t always work because deepfake images can be slightly changed (cropped, resized, or filtered). Our approach will look at the actual content of the images to find duplicates, even if they have been modified.
Problem Statement
Deepfake detection has been an active area of research, but distinguishing duplicate deepfake images from large datasets remains a challenge. Traditional hash-based or metadata-driven duplicate detection methods fail when deepfakes undergo transformations such as resizing, cropping, and slight modifications. This project proposes using CNN-based feature extraction and similarity analysis to effectively detect duplicate deepfake images.

Objectives
Develop a CNN-based model to extract features from deepfake images.
Compare extracted features to detect duplicates using similarity measures.
Evaluate the model on benchmark deepfake datasets.
Optimize the model for robustness against transformations such as cropping, noise addition, and compression.
Methodology
Dataset Collection: Gather real and deepfake image datasets from publicly available sources such as FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, or custom deepfake-generated datasets.
Preprocessing: Normalize images, apply data augmentation, and handle imbalanced data.
Feature Extraction with CNN: Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, or EfficientNet) or train a custom CNN to extract deepfake image features.
Similarity Measurement: Use cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or Siamese networks to detect duplicate deepfake images.
Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Expected Outcome
A trained CNN model capable of detecting duplicate deepfake images with high accuracy.
A robust system resistant to minor transformations in deepfake images.
A contribution to deepfake detection research by improving duplicate identification methods.
